# RTS-property-extraction

Analyis of the use of digital elevation models (DEM) generated from remote sensing observation for the extraction of retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) properties in the Canadian High Arctic. Data was acquired by TanDEM-X and ArcticDEM satellites between 2009 and 2017.

ArcticDEM geospatial data can be downloaded from https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/arcticdem/

These scripts were used to download, pre-process, and display the digital elevation models. In the case of ArcicDEM data, a translation vector was applied to correct the offset to filtered IceSAT altimetry data. DEMs-differencing was then manually executed in ArcMap.

RTS activity has been characterized through the calculation of properties such as volumetric change, headwall height and retreat rate. RTS formation was clearly visible by differencing digital elevation models over time.
